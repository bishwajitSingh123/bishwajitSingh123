### 🧬 Engineering Philosophy
I specialize in bridging the gap between research architectures and production environments. My work focuses on **Medical Image Segmentation** and **Landmark Detection**, specifically addressing the challenges of high-noise modalities like Ultrasound. I prioritize robust inference pipelines and reproducible systems over notebook-only experiments.

### 🔬 Key Projects (Case Studies)

#### 🏥 [Fetal Ultrasound Biometry: Medical AI](https://github.com/bishwajitSingh123/fetal-ultrasound-biometry)
> **Primary focus:** Solving segmentation challenges in low-contrast, noisy clinical ultrasound data.

* **Performance:** Achieved **0.95+ Dice Score** with a median localization error of **~6 px**.
* **Evolution:** Iterative architecture optimization from Standard U-Net → Attention U-Net → ResNet-UNet.
* **Clinical Reality:** Designed specifically to handle real-world ultrasound constraints (blur, artifacts).
* **Engineering:** Full inference-ready pipeline with reproducibility at its core.

#### 🤖 [AI Resume Matcher: RAG System](https://github.com/bishwajitSingh123/ai-resume-matcher)
* **Architecture:** Semantic matching using vector similarity (FAISS) and explainable scoring.
* **Utility:** High-precision retrieval workflow without hallucination overhead.

#### 🚖 [Taxi Trip Time Prediction](https://github.com/bishwajitSingh123/taxi-trip-prediction)
* **Achievement:** **Top-15 Global Rank** on Kaggle.
* **Focus:** Rigorous feature engineering and validation discipline.
